# Recipe-App
Make an easy choice from three recipe options based on either the ingredients in your kitchen, health restrictions, and/or the cuisine of your desire, and feel satisfied with your choice! This application calls on two different APIs utlizing your unput to deliver desired recipes. Design primarily by Materialize.

We all struggle figuring out what we want to eat and this has become harder with more choices than ever</br>
("Decision Paralysis" is real people!(</br>

Find two APIs that have enough interesting information to use for a decent website </br>(and are also not a complete pain-in-the-a$$ to work with)</br>

## Front End
The front end made use of primarily the Materialize framework and Google Fonts, supprted design aesthetics & responsiveness with local css styling, and then finished off with a jQuery Plugin for social media sharing just to have a working MVP.

### Materialize
Key features include:
- scrollspy() 
- parallax() 
- formselect()
- autocomplete() </br>
. . . which are all initialized in app.js

We also utilized Materialize's:
- grid system
- buttons
- z-index
- containers
- forms
- cards / card reveal

### Google Fonts
For font we leaned toward a more rustic and light-hearted font, reminiscent to that which might appear on a chalkboard at a modern, trendy and healthy restaurant in a sunny Southern California. <strong>Our choice?</strong> <em>'Rock Salt', cursive</em> 

## Back End
